However, the statistics on the goals scored can be misleading, as one season of overperformance can make a mediocre striker look like a top one and vice versa; a season of underperformance can raise doubts about a quality striker’s prowess. Therefore, analyzing the amount and quality of the moments that the forward can generate is much better.</p></div><div class=imageblock><div class=content><img src=npxG.png alt=npxG></div><div class=title>Figure 1. npxG and shots per 90. Opta, FBref</div></div><div class=paragraph><p>The data shows that all these players have more shots per 90 minutes than Giroud, while Joshua Zirkzee is the only player with fewer npxG per 90 minutes, standing at 0.26 npxG per 90, which indicates that he’s not the one who can score a lot. Santiago Giménez and Victor Boniface are the outliers, being the most dangerous strikers on the list with 0.73 and 0.76 npxG, respectively.</p></div><div class=imageblock><div class=content><img src=giroud_sm_rp.png alt="giroud sm rp" width=374 height=239></div><div class=title>Figure 2.

So, even for the younger attackers, it is tough to outshine his aerial dominance.</p></div><div class=imageblock><div class=content><img src=aerials.png alt=aerials></div><div class=title>Figure 29. Aerial duels won. Opta, FBref</div></div><div class=paragraph><p>No wonder only a 194 cm tall Benjamin Šeško wins more aerial duels than the Frenchman. At the same time, Jonathan David struggles the most, winning only 0.64 aerial duels per 90.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=_consistency>Consistency</h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>Being strong one season is good, but consistency throughout multiple seasons can indicate a player’s real level. Since all the analyzed players are young, it is natural that not many of them have multiple top-level seasons behind their backs. For Šeško and Boniface, this is their first season in the top-5 leagues. Zirkzee was part of the Bologna squad last season but only played 822 minutes, so this is also his first season as a starter player among the strongest. Despite having incredible stats, Gyökeres and Giménez have yet to play in the top 5 leagues. The only player who has proven his level throughout the year is Lille’s forward, Jonathan David. After two great seasons at Gent, he moved to the French site in 2021 and is hitting a double figure of goals, excluding penalties, for the fourth season in a row.
Although it seems a correct decision to buy a player before he has reached his maximum potential, Milan will require a proven goal scorer who will make a difference from the first season.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=_conclusion>Conclusion</h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>After analyzing these players, we see that they all have the potential to become stars and shine in the top clubs. Let’s see who is a better match for Milan’s new striker.</p></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_jonathan_david>Jonathan David</h3><div class=paragraph><p>The Canadian striker has proven his abilities over the years, and he is my personal favorite. He is strong in scoring goals, creating chances, and helping in the build-up. However, he has an apparent weakness in aerial duels, which might be crucial when playing against a low-block team that Milan has struggled against for years.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_joshua_zirkzee>Joshua Zirkzee</h3><div class=paragraph><p>Despite being a strong player with great talent, he is not likely to score many goals. His main strength shines outside the penalty area, creating chances for his teammates. This raises doubts about whether it is the right choice to replace Giroud. Rossoneri does not have a shortage of players who can carry the ball and create space and chances for the other; instead, they need someone capable of finishing these chances.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_benjamin_šeško>Benjamin Šeško</h3><div class=paragraph><p>He is the most straightforward Giroud replacement. He is a classical target man with a strong aerial presence, but he is much younger, thus more mobile and faster than the French striker. However, there are questions about whether he’s ready to be a starter for a top Italian club since he’s far from being a regular starter at RB Leipzig, starting only 13 matches in 29 matchdays in the Bundesliga this season.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_victor_boniface>Victor Boniface</h3><div class=paragraph><p>He’s a jack of all trades, thriving in every aspect of the game. He’s a constant threat to the goal, present in the build-up, great at progressing the ball, and creates chances for others.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_viktor_gyökeres>Viktor Gyökeres</h3><div class=paragraph><p>One of the most discussed strikers in the market, with an incredible 27 goals and 12 assists this season so far. Although these numbers come from an overperformance season, he’s still a constant threat to the opposition’s goal and, based on the data, the most versatile striker on the list.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_santiago_giménez>Santiago Giménez</h3><div class=paragraph><p>Second most dangerous striker on the list, after Viktor Boniface. Although he’s less involved in the build-up play, his presence in the box constantly threatens the opponents. It’s worth saying that he is playing in the weakest league, making him the riskiest option to replace Olivie Giroud. On the other hand, if the risk pays off, Rossoneri will finally have a top-level striker who can make a difference.</p></div></div></div></div><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/data-analysis/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">Data-Analysis</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/forward/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">Forward</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://hugo-asciidoc-blog.netlify.app/>&copy; Football Fanalytics 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
